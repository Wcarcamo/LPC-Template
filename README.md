LPC Template
======================================================
This repository provides a R Markdown template for LPC Consulting Associates, where I currently work. 

This template was made possible with the help of Mikey Harper's template examples. If you would like to learn more, see his [templates](https://github.com/dr-harper/example-rmd-templates).

## Installing the Template

Run the following code:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Wcarcamo/LPC-Template")
```

This will install the package `LPC`.
